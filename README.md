### final  testing stage - 
Speaker training accuracy - 100% <br>
Speaker testing accuracy - 100% <br>
class recording zero accuracy training - 100% <br>
class recording zero accuracy testing - 13/18 <br>
class recording twelve accuracy training - 100% <br> 
class recoding twelve accuracy testing - 14/18 <br>

overall accuracy -> 91%

lbg_try5.m -> vector quantization and centroid clustering <br>
phase1_eec201_1 -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on speaker data <br>
phase2_eec201_1-> data preprocessing and feature extraction on class speaker data on  "zero" <br>
phas3_eec201_1 -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on class speaker data on  "twelve" <br>
test_twelve_1 -> testing for accuracies on training and testing datasets for recording 'twelve' in class <br>
test_zero_1 -> testing for accuracies on training adn testing datasets for recording 'zero' in class <br>

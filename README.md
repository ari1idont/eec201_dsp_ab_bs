### Code in working condition - work to be completed -> spectrogram plots, centroid visualization.  
### Currest testing stage - 
Speaker training accuracy - 100% <br>
Speaker testing accuracy - 6/8 <br>
class recording zero accuracy training - 100% <br>
class recording zero accuracy testing - 11/18 <br>
class recording twelve accuracy training - 100% <br> 
class recoding twelve accuracy testing - 11/18 <br>

Work planned over the weekend - imporving testing accuracies and working on plot visualization.

lbg_try5.m -> vector quantization and centroid clustering <br>
phase1_eec201_final_proj -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on speaker data <br>
phase2_eec201_proj -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on class speaker data on work "zero" <br>
phas3_eec201_proj -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on class speaker data on work "twelve" <br>
test_twelve_1 -> testing for accuracies on training and testing datasets for recording 'twelve' in class <br>
test_zero_1 -> testing for accuracies on training adn testing datasets for recording 'zero' in class <br>
decesion_rule3 -> testing for accuracies on training and test datasets for speaker recordings.

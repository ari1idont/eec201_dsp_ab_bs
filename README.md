Code in working condition - work to be completed -> spectrogram plots, centroid visualization. 
Currest testing stage - 
Speaker training accuracy - 100%
Speaker testing accuracy - 6/8
class recording zero accuracy training - 100%
class recording zero accuracy testing - 11/18
class recording twelve accuracy training - 100%
class recoding twelve accuracy testing - 11/18

Work planned over the weekend - imporving testing accuracies and working on plot visualization.

lbg_try5.m -> vector quantization and centroid clustering
phase1_eec201_final_proj -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on speaker data
phase2_eec201_proj -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on class speaker data on work "zero"
phas3_eec201_proj -> data preprocessing and feature extraction on class speaker data on work "twelve"
test_twelve_1 -> testing for accuracies on training and testing datasets for recording 'twelve' in class
test_zero_1 -> testing for accuracies on training adn testing datasets for recording 'zero' in class
decesion_rule3 -> testing for accuracies on training and test datasets for speaker recordings.
